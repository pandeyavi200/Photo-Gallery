This project is basically using an image api to fetch data and show it within the app.
This project has 3 sections:
1- Gallery: This section contains the photos fetched from api and is displayed in a proper manner. Some material ui items has been used.
2- Collections: This section contains all the collections created by the user. Each colection is shown by a card with background image in it along with the name and description.
3- Create Collection: This section allows us to create collections by selecting images displayed using api.
NavBar is resonsible for moving to the different sections.
